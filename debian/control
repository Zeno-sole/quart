Description: Python ASGI web microframework with the same API as Flask (Documentation)
 Quart is a Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the
 easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially
 with existing Flask apps. This is possible as the Quart API is a superset
 of the Flask API.
 .
 Quart aims to be a complete web microframework, as it supports HTTP/1.1,
 HTTP/2 and websockets. Quart is very extendable and has a number of
 known extensions and works with many of the Flask extensions.
 .
 Quart supports the full ASGI 3.0 specification as well as the websocket
 response and HTTP/2 server push extensions. For those of you familiar
 with Flask, Quart extends the Flask API by adding support for:
 .
  * HTTP/1.1 request streaming
  * Websockets
  * HTTP/2 server push
 .
 This package contains the documentation and examples.
